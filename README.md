# Liri Bot

Liri makes it possible to use several APIs through a simple command line interface.

Users can use Liri to find information about upcoming concerts, songs, and movies. Search requests are entered at the terminal with a command/search term syntax or a menu-based terminal interface. Liri makes use of Band In Town, Spotify, the OMBD APIs.
