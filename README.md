# liri-node-app

PURPOSE

Liri makes it possible to use APIs through a simple command line interface.

OVERVIEW

Liri takes in a command line argument and search term, then uses that input to request upcoming concerts with the Band in Town api, song information with the node-spotify-api, and movie information with the OMBD api.

Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app

2. Install Node
3. Open a terminal at the repo folder and enter node liri.js
4. Make a menu selection, e.g., "concert-this", "spotify-this", movie-this"
