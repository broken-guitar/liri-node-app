# Liri Bot

Liri makes it possible to use several APIs through a simple command line interface.

Users can use Liri to find information about upcoming concerts, songs, and movies. Search requests are entered at the terminal with a command/search term syntax or a menu-based terminal interface. Liri makes use of Band In Town, Spotify, the OMBD APIs.

PURPOSE

Liri makes it possible to use APIs through a simple command line interface.

OVERVIEW

Liri takes in a command line argument and search term, then uses that input to request upcoming concerts with the Band in Town api, song information with the node-spotify-api, and movie information with the OMBD api.

Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Install Node

4. Make a menu selection, e.g., "concert-this", "spotify-this", movie-this"
5. When prompted, input the name of a band/artist, song, or movie,
6. Liri will return the result or error message to the console and log the results in a "log.txt" file.

TODO Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning

TODO Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
